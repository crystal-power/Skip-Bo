# Skip-Bo

Skip-Bo is a card game where 2 to 6 players race to be the first to empty their personal Stock pile of cards. The game involves playing cards in sequential order (1 through 12, with Skip-Bo cards acting as wilds) onto shared Building piles in the center, using cards from their hand, their individual Discard piles, and the top card of their Stock pile.
